package Polymorphism;
//It's - same name but multiple forms (action/behavior)

//	2 types:
//1. Compile time / early binding / static binding / overloading
//	(it's just different names, all they are the same)
// 		Example: RBI class - 2 methods with same name BUT
//	different method signature (parameters)
//InterviewQst: Can we achieve overloading by keeping the method
//signature and changing the return type? Answer: NO!!!
//-----------------------------------------------
//2. Runtime time / late binding / dynamic binding / overriding
